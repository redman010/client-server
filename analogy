Clients are mainly considered Clients by the action of requesting and getting data from one or many servers. A server is a provider of data to one or many clients. A server can also be considered a client if it requests data from a different server. When I think of the client and server relationship, I think of the relationship between a company and customers.  Like a server, a store contains all the stuff the client/ customer will potentially need. The client/customer can request what they want from the store by ordering it or asking for it. The client/customer gets the item(s) that they were requesting by paying for it.
 Also just like stores, servers have different classification based on what services they provide. Therefore a hardware store is a hardware store because it sells tools, things of that nature, and a mail server is a mail server because it handles data in regards to mail. Some other types of servers are Proxy Server, Server Platforms, Web Server, Application Server, Real-Time Communication Server, FTP Server, Collaboration Server.
